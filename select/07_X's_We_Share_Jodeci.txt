Verse 1:

Oh girl I see you
The time is so right
Let's plan a day
Let's go out at night
Let's make this special
Remember our fun
Go through the storms
And look back on

Chorus:

The times we shared together
Make it last forever
The times we shared together
Make it last forever

Verse 2:

Can't forget the night
We watched for the sun
We laughed and played
Then morning comes
Just like the day we started our heart
It was sunrise when we made our first love
The times

Chorus

Bridge:

The times we shared together
Let's make it last forever
Just like the morning sun
We laughed and played now til morning come
I like the way you kiss me
Holding me girl when we do this
It keeps me rising high
All our love will never die
Nothing could compare to the love we share
Say nothing not a thing girl
Could compare to the love we share together
Oh girl I see you
I wanna do you tonight
