I remember drivin' to my side
Smoke's up, windows open
The sun's in our eyes but it's alright
'Cause we don't know where we're goin'

We don't need no mirror pointin' back
Forget about the past, what's done is done and that is that
You didn't have more than the shirt that's on your back
But I'll never forget the way you turned to me and said

When the good times are rollin' on me
I got plenty in my pocket if you're ever in need
Bad times know where I've been
I got plenty in my pocket if you're ever in need
Singing, oh, oh, oh, share that love
Oh, oh, oh, share that love
Good times are rollin' on me
I got plenty in my pocket if you're ever in need

I remember you on the lifeline
Holdin' on for daylight
Prayin' to the heavens that you're alright
Yeah, you know I'm on your side

We don't need no mirror pointin' back
Forget about the past, what's done is done and that is that
You didn't have more than the shirt that's on your back
But I'll never forget the way you turned to me and said

When the good times are rollin' on me
I got plenty in my pocket if you're ever in need
Bad times know where I've been
I got plenty in my pocket if you're ever in need
Singing oh, oh, oh, share that love
Oh, oh, oh, share that love
Good times are rollin' on me (yeah)
I got plenty in my pocket, if you're ever in need (ayy)

We don't need no mirror pointin' back
It's funny, I regret the life you livin' in the past
We used to have the wall against our backs
I can still remember when you turned to me and said

When the good times are rollin' on me
I got plenty in my pocket if you're ever in need
Bad times know where I've been
I got plenty in my pocket if you're ever in need
Singing oh, oh, oh, share that love
Oh, oh, oh, share that love
Good times are rollin' on me (yeah)
I got plenty in my pocket, if you're ever in need (singin')

Oh, oh, oh, share that love
Oh, oh, oh, share that love
